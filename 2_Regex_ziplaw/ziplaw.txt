BEGIN

1. IMPORT required libraries:
   - requests (for downloading text)
   - re (for word extraction)
   - collections.Counter (for frequency counting)
   - numpy (for numerical arrays)
   - matplotlib.pyplot (for plotting)

2. FETCH a large text corpus:
   - Example: Gutenberg text (e.g., Shakespeare’s works)
   - Store text content in a variable

3. PREPROCESS text:
   - Convert to lowercase
   - Extract words using regex (pattern: \b[a-z]+\b)
   - Create a list of all word tokens

4. COMPUTE word frequencies:
   - Use Counter(words) to count occurrences
   - Sort by frequency (most_common())

5. PREPARE data for Zipf’s Law:
   - ranks = [1, 2, 3, ..., N]
   - frequencies = list of word counts in decreasing order

6. PLOT log–log graph:
   - X-axis → log(rank)
   - Y-axis → log(frequency)
   - Expect near-linear relationship (slope ≈ -1)

7. DISPLAY plot and analyze:
   - A straight line indicates Zipf’s Law holds true.
